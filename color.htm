        <center><h1> This hue of red makes me feel sick. On paper, it may be fine, but whenever I see a red this bright on a screen it is really hard to see. The main purpose of this color is to catch the viewer off guard. For example, in Insidious, every intro where it says “<style color="#FF1200"> INSIDIOUS </style> ” in big letters, the letters are this hue of red and a terrifying noise plays. So this color makes me feel sick and gives me a headache.</h1></center>
